# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction – EDA & Feature Engineering

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Feature Engineering** using the Flight Price dataset. The objective is to clean, preprocess, and engineer features to prepare the data for future machine learning models.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle or similar
- Files Used:
  - `FPP_train.csv`
  - `FPP_test.csv`

---

## 🔧 Steps Performed

✅ Merged train and test datasets  
✅ Dropped irrelevant features (`Additional_Info`, etc.)  
✅ Converted `Date_of_Journey`, `Dep_Time`, `Arrival_Time` into useful features  
✅ Cleaned & split `Duration` into hours and minutes  
✅ Handled missing values  
✅ Encoded categorical variables using:
  - Label Encoding (`Total_Stops`)
  - One-Hot Encoding (`Airline`, `Source`, `Destination`)  
✅ Exported clean dataset for model training

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
